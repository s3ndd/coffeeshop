  # Assume this coffee shop only provides hot coffee
  # For iced coffee, the brewer would be replaced with an iced brewer
  # the logic for the iced brewer would be similar to the brewer
  # Assume all the coffee types use the same coffee beans and same roast, for example, all use medium arabica beans
  # Assume all the coffee types do not add milk
  # beansToWaterRatio is the ratio of coffee beans to water, for example, 0.18 means 18g of coffee beans to 100g of water
  # Assume all the coffee type sizes are standard cup sizes.
  # Larger sizes are made by adding 1.25 time the size of the standard size
  # Extra sizes are made by adding 1.5 time the size of the standard size
